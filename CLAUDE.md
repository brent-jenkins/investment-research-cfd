# cfdinvest

A multi-asset CFD backtesting engine and **manual-trading assistant**. It
models strategies, measures risk, and helps you place trades on Trading 212
yourself. It has never placed one.

---

## Hard constraints

These are standing instructions from the project owner, not preferences.

- **Trading 212 is never automated.** No T212 endpoints, public or private,
  and no automation of its interface. This is not a preference either — the
  owner confirmed there is no CFD API, so any automation would mean driving
  the web UI, which breaches their terms.
- **Execution is opt-in, explicit, and off by default.** A broker client may
  exist; it may not place an order because a config file drifted. Anything
  that can trade says so in its name, is gated on an explicit setting, and
  refuses to act against a live account without one.
- **The paper book stays a simulation.** It must never become the thing that
  places orders. Its whole value is being a record nobody could have
  edited after the outcome, and a book that sometimes trades is not that.
- **No credentials in code, in logs, or in the repository.** Secrets are read
  from the environment or `/etc/cfdinvest/env`. The dashboard redacts. This
  matters more now than it did: a broker API key and password are not a
  FRED key, and a leak is a funded account rather than a rate limit.
- **Demo before live.** A broker integration is developed and measured
  against the demo environment. Pointing it at a live account is a separate,
  deliberate act.
- **Read-only except for the layer's own writes.** Each layer names exactly
  what it may write in its README.
- **No config mutation.**

Several packages enforce their own isolation structurally — `tests/` parses
their imports and fails the build on `requests`, `urllib`, `selenium`, the
backtest engine, or the scheduler's runner. Those restrictions are
package-scoped and still stand: the analysis, bias, insights and refinement
layers have no business talking to a network whatever the broker situation
is. Keep them passing rather than adjusting them.

**What changed, and when.** Until 2026-08-26 this section forbade broker API
calls and trade execution outright. That constraint existed because Trading
212 cannot be automated, not because automation was unwanted — so it was
contingent, and it lapsed when an IG demo CFD account was opened. It is
replaced rather than deleted, because most of what it protected is
unchanged and the rest matters more once real credentials exist.

The first use is read-only, and on 2026-08-27 it did what it was for: all
twenty spreads were measured on a Capital.com demo account without placing
an order, because that broker returns bid and offer where IG would not.

**Two figures previously stated here were wrong**, and the measurement is
what exposed them. The estimated spread was described as a per-class
constant of 4bp round trip. It is 10bp: `spread_bps` is unset and no
asset-class map is supplied, so the lookup falls through to
`default_spread_bps = 5.0` — a *half* spread — and the `equity: 2.0` entry
in `DEFAULT_SPREAD_BPS` never applies to anything. And it is 46.6% of
modelled cost, not 79%: measured over the whole backtest, spread 46.6%,
slippage 37.3%, financing 12.2%, FX 3.8%.

Measured, the median is 5.3bp round trip against the 10bp charged, ranging
from 2.8bp (META, COST) to 28.6bp (NKE). So the model has been overstating
the largest line rather than understating it. Every price checked against
the vendor to within 0.04%, which is what says the instruments resolved
correctly rather than to lookalike listings.

### Before every commit

`.env` holds a live FRED API key and is git-ignored. Verify all three:

```bash
git check-ignore -v .env                          # must be ignored
git diff --cached --name-only | grep -x '\.env'   # must find nothing
KEY=$(grep -oE '[A-Za-z0-9]{32,}' .env | head -1)
git grep -I --cached -l -F -- "$KEY"              # must find nothing
```

The owner's Trading 212 basic-auth password has also been shared in
conversation. It is not in the repository and must not enter it — the Caddy
config reads a bcrypt hash from the environment, and
`tests/test_deployment.py` fails the build if anything password-shaped appears
under `deployment/`.

## Commands

```bash
pytest                      # ~2,500 tests, offline, about two minutes
pytest -m live              # hits the real FRED API; excluded by default
pytest tests/test_risk.py -q

python -m streamlit run cfdinvest/ui/app.py --server.address 127.0.0.1
cfdinvest-helper "long SPX500 0.68 entry=4434.8 stop=4390" --balance 2000
cfdinvest-confirm open SPX500 --price 4434.8 --quantity 0.684
cfdinvest-schedule run-once | monitor | risk-snapshot
```

`--server.address 127.0.0.1` is load-bearing in deployment: without it
Streamlit binds every interface and answers past Caddy's basic auth.

## The principles every layer follows

These recur because they were each learned from a bug. They are the house
style, and a new layer that departs from one should say why.

**Absence is named, never inferred.** A figure that could not be computed is
reported absent — never defaulted, never zero. "Not measured" and "measured
and fine" are different statements, and only one is reassuring. This is why
`unchecked` exists alongside `pass`, why `BiasProfile` severities stay `None`,
and why an empty rules table reports *unverified* rather than compliant.

**Anything uncomputable caps a verdict.** In the live helper, an unknown
exchange rate or leverage caps the answer at `BORDERLINE`. It never reaches
`SAFE` on incomplete information.

**One owner per threshold.** A limit lives in exactly one config object and
is read from there. `ui/health.py` takes its numbers from
`monitoring.MonitoringThresholds`; the refinement layer reads
`LiveHelperConfig`; several tests parse modules and fail the build on a
redeclared limit. Two copies drift, and the day they drift the banner says
fine while the email says critical.

**Observations are append-only; configuration is rewritten.** Snapshots,
confirmations, journal entries and assessments are appended and never edited —
they describe moments that do not come back. The account registry is the one
exception, because it says what exists *now*.

**Accounting identities are asserted, not assumed.** The P&L components sum to
the total; equity equals initial plus cumulative. Tests check this.

**Every number carries its sample.** Below a floor, no claim is made — the
figures stay available and the *assertion* is withheld. The floor is higher in
`bias/` than in `insights/` because behavioural inference is weaker evidence
and because those severities shrink real positions.

**Cutting is cheaper than raising.** Any single adverse finding may reduce
size. Increasing it requires every requirement clear at once, and the result
is still capped by the safety engine. See `metastrategy/README.md`.

**A posture may request an increase but cannot exceed the safety engine's
approved maximum**; overrules are reported explicitly.

**Broker checks report pass / not checked / unverified**; silence is never
treated as safe.

---

## Testing

Tests are the deliverable, not a formality.

- **Mutation-check every suite.** Reintroduce each property as a bug and
  confirm the test fails. Several real gaps were found this way — tautological
  assertions, unreachable guards, tests that passed either way. Each layer's
  README lists the mutations that were checked.
- **Test the property, not the constant.** Asserting `component.score ==
  UNMEASURED` moves with the constant and proves nothing.
- **Run the real thing on real data.** Most of the serious bugs in this
  project surfaced from a smoke test on `runner_lake`, not from unit tests:
  the categorical Parquet bug, the drawdown denominator, the units mismatch in
  the simulation. Treat a surprising number as a bug.
- **Prose in a wrapped block needs whitespace normalisation** to assert on —
  `" ".join(text.split())`.

## Layer map

Read the package README before changing a package; each explains the failure
it exists to prevent.

| | |
| --- | --- |
| `ingestion/` `repository.py` `storage.py` | The lake |
| `preprocessing/` `regimes/` `signals/` | Panels, classifications, targets |
| `execution/` `backtest/` | Fills, spread, slippage, FX, financing, stops |
| `analytics/` | Metrics, attribution, sweeps, walk-forward, Monte Carlo |
| `persist/` | Every artefact store. Account-aware. |
| `schedule/` | Runner, market calendar, notifications |
| `risk/` `monitoring/` | Book-level limits; operational health |
| `livehelper/` | The T212 safety core: intent, safety, sizing, broker rules, refinement |
| `confirm/` `journal/` `insights/` `bias/` | What you did, and what it says |
| `simulate/` `metastrategy/` | Rehearsal; risk posture |
| `accounts/` | Registry and router |
| `ui/` | 21 Streamlit pages. Optional install. |

**Where things are computed once and read everywhere:** expectancy in
`analytics/`, regime labels in `risk.compute_regime_risk`, scheduler status in
`risk.scheduler_status`, fills in `execution/`. Never add a second.

## Conventions

- **A README per package**, explaining the failure it prevents, the judgement
  calls, and the mutations checked. Not an API listing.
- **Comments explain *why*.** The codebase's value is largely in the reasons —
  why a stop widens in high volatility, why an outcome is a separate journal
  entry. Match that density.
- **Commit messages are prose**, several paragraphs, explaining the decisions
  and anything found while building. End with the `Co-Authored-By` trailer.
- **Dashboard pages** live in `ui/views/`, numbered `NN_Name.py`, registered
  in `ui/app.py: PAGES` and in `tests/test_ui.py`'s layout list. Spec page
  numbers in older specs have drifted; append rather than renumber.
  **The directory must not be called `pages/`** — Streamlit auto-discovers
  that name and builds its own sidebar from it, which no amount of
  `st.navigation` suppresses; a signed-out visitor saw every page name.
- **Follow the spec's file layout** where it does not conflict with what
  exists; say so when deviating.

---

## Traps that have cost time

- **Heredoc escaping.** `\n` inside a `<<'PY'` heredoc becomes a real newline
  and corrupts f-strings and regexes. Use raw strings, or the Write/Edit tools
  for anything containing escapes. This has bitten repeatedly.
- **A categorical column index does not survive a Parquet round trip.**
  `storage.write_parquet` flattens it; every `positions.parquet` was
  unreadable before that fix.
- **A callable inside the `read_everything` bundle breaks caching.** That
  bundle goes through `st.cache_data`, which pickles what it stores, so a
  lambda in it fails to cache and takes everything else in the bundle with
  it — and the symptom is a *different* page rendering blank, not an error
  where the lambda is. Lazy artefacts go in their own module-level function.
- **Streamlit keeps `sys.modules` across reruns.** A long-running server runs
  new page scripts against old modules. Restart it after changing
  `components.py` or `sources.py`.
- **`Series == pytest.approx(scalar)` does not broadcast.** Use `np.allclose`.
- **`x or fallback` treats a legitimate zero as missing.** This hid a
  zero-bar run from the monitoring layer.
- **The signal frame's `size` is a share of equity**, not a unit count. The
  simulation was a no-op until that conversion was added.
- **Wrap prose in the helper's summary.** The block is 68 columns; unwrapped
  lines have escaped three times.

## Current state

All queued layers are built, tested and pushed. The suite is green.

The Meta-Strategy layer is built, tested, mutation-checked and integrated;
all refinement inputs now exist.

The lake freshness warning appears until ingestion is run; monitoring
reports stale data as a warning.

**The broker rules are filled in.** All forty instruments were read off the
Trading 212 app by the owner and recorded in `config/t212_rules.toml`, which
the deploy installs to `~/.config/cfdinvest/t212_rules.toml`. That file is the
single source: it used to be a commented-out template, a gitignored working
copy and a hand-copied live file, which is three ways for one table to go
stale. Every entry names its source, and a test fails the build on one that
does not — the fear that kept the table empty was invented figures that look
measured, and provenance is the answer to it rather than emptiness.

Minimums vary by instrument type and only seven are read so far; the rest
report *unverified*, which is correct rather than a gap.

**Account separation is opt-in.** With `CFD_ACCOUNT_MODE` unset everything
uses the shared root, exactly as before it existed. See
`deployment/README.md` for the migration.

The root `README.md` is out of date — it describes the project as
"ingestion layer complete".
